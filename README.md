# React Projects Learning (by John Smilga)

Welcome to my personal repository where I document and build every mini-project from [John Smilga's React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/).

This repo is structured to help me:
- Practice each concept thoroughly
- Track progress in an organized way
- Build a habit of coding consistently

---

##  Structure

Each folder inside this repo corresponds to a major topic or project module from the course.  
Every folder contains:
- The source code of the mini-project(s)
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining what I learned and built

# Navbar Project with useRef

This mini-project builds a responsive navigation bar using `React`, `useRef`, and dynamic styling. It was created as part of my learning from [John Smilga's React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/).

The project demonstrates how to dynamically toggle elements based on DOM height using `useRef` and `getBoundingClientRect()`.

## Key Concepts

- `useRef` for DOM access
- `getBoundingClientRect()` to calculate dynamic height
- Conditional class toggling
- Responsive design via CSS
- Toggling nav links using React state
